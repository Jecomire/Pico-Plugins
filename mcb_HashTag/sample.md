## Hashtag
A hashtag is a word or a phrase prefixed with the symbol #. It is a form of metadata tag. Short messages on microblogging and social networking services such as Twitter or Instagram may be tagged by putting "#" before important words, either as they appear in a sentence, (eg. "New artists announced for #SXSW 2012 Music Festival!")[3] or appended to it.  

Hashtags provide a means of #grouping such messages, since one can search for the hashtag and get the set of messages that contain it.

## Style
On microblogging or social networking sites, hashtags can be inserted anywhere within a post: before the body of a post, within the body of a post (usually as part of the body, as in "This is a #hashtag" or "This is #CamelCase") or after the body of a post as a postscript.
